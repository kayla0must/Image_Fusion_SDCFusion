The method consists of three major components:

1. **Scene Discriminator**: Uses a CLIP-based vision-language model to classify degradation types.
2. **Degradation Correction Units**: Integrates two lightweight modules:
   - **BANet** for brightness adjustment
   - **DFNet** for dehazing
3. **Fusion Backbone**: A multi-stage feature extraction and reconstruction network that merges corrected visible and infrared features.

SDCFuse is trained in **three stages** to progressively enhance the fusion quality with degradation-aware correction.
